# DocGen Project
================

## Overview

DocGen is a Python library system that allows users to manage and display their book inventory. It provides a simple example of how to create classes, add books, and show the inventory.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

* `./DocGen.Modelfile`: The main model file for the library system.
* `./docs/PROJECT_README.md`: A README file that describes the project's purpose and usage.
* `./Pipeline.Modelfile`: A pipeline file that contains the code logic for managing the library system.
* `./tests`: A directory containing test files for the library system.
	+ `./tests/server.log`: A log file for testing server-side functionality.
	+ `./tests/data.csv` and `./tests/data.json`: Sample data files for testing book inventory management.
	+ `./tests/python_example.py`: An example Python script that demonstrates how to use the library system.

## Usage Instructions

To use DocGen, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/DocGen.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd DocGen`
3. Run the pipeline file: `python Pipeline.Modelfile.py` (assuming it's a Python script)
4. Use the example Python script in `tests/python_example.py` to add books and show the inventory.

Note: This README.md will be updated as new files are added or existing ones modified.
