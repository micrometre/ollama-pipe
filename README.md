# Code Review Model File

This is a model file that serves as the entry point for our code review process. It maps each file to its corresponding purpose and provides usage instructions.

## Project Overview
The project consists of three files: `CodeReview.Modelfile`, `CodeReviewV1.Modelfile`, and `commented_ollama.py`. The first two files are model files that define the structure and organization of our codebase. The third file is a test script that demonstrates how to use the models.

## File Structure
The project has the following directory structure:
```markdown
CodeReview/
Modelfile/
README.md
...
commented_ollama.py
```
Each file has a specific purpose:

* `Modelfile/`: Model files that define the structure and organization of our codebase.
	+ `CodeReview.Modelfile`: The main model file for our project.
	+ `CodeReviewV1.Modelfile`: A version 1.0 model file for our project.
* `README.md`: A README file that provides an overview of our project and its purpose.
* `commented_ollama.py`: A test script that demonstrates how to use the models.

## Usage Instructions
To use the models, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeReview.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd CodeReview`
3. Run the tests: `python commented_ollama.py`

The test script will demonstrate how to use the models and provide usage instructions for each file.

## Model Files
### CodeReview.Modelfile

This is the main model file for our project. It defines the structure and organization of our codebase.
```markdown
# CodeReview.Modelfile

## Overview

This is the main model file for our project. It provides a clear and concise overview of our codebase.

## File Structure

* `CodeReview.Modelfile`: The main model file for our project.
```
### CodeReviewV1.Modelfile

This is a version 1.0 model file for our project. It builds upon the structure defined in `CodeReview.Modelfile`.
```markdown
# CodeReviewV1.Modelfile

## Overview

This is a version 1.0 model file for our project. It provides an updated overview of our codebase.

## File Structure

* `CodeReview.V1.Modelfile`: The main model file for our project.
```
### commented_ollama.py

This test script demonstrates how to use the models and provides usage instructions for each file.
```markdown
# commented_ollama.py

import CodeReviewModelfile as modelfile
modelfile.main_function()

print("Usage Instructions:")
print("-----------------")
print("To run the tests, navigate into the project directory and run `python commented_ollama.py`.")
```
Note: The usage instructions are provided in the README.md file for easy reference.
